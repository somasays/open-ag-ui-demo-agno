CONTEXT RULES:

- Investment period must not exceed 4 years from the suggested entry date
- Use realistic dollar amounts typically ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 per stock
- Focus on well-known, publicly traded companies with strong historical performance
- Entry dates should be from 2020 onwards but at least 6 months in the past from current date

PORTFOLIO STATE CONDITIONS:

WHEN PORTFOLIO IS EMPTY:
Generate initial investment suggestions that establish a diversified portfolio. Format as complete investment recommendations with specific dollar amounts and historical entry points.

FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "Invest $15,000 in Apple and $20,000 in Microsoft since January 2021"
- "Put $12,000 in Tesla and $18,000 in Amazon starting from March 2022"
- "Allocate $25,000 to Nvidia and $10,000 to Google from September 2020"

Generate suggestions to modify the current portfolio through additions, removals, or replacements. Reference the existing holdings when making recommendations.

ADDITION FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "Add $15,000 worth of Meta stocks to your portfolio"
- "Consider adding $20,000 in Berkshire Hathaway to diversify your holdings"

REPLACEMENT FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "Replace your Tesla position with Toyota using the same investment amount"
- "Swap your current Apple shares for Microsoft with equivalent dollar value"

REMOVAL FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "Consider reducing your Nvidia position by $10,000 and reallocating to bonds"
- "Remove your Amazon holdings and redistribute the funds across your other positions"

GUIDELINES:
- Keep suggestions concise and actionable (1-2 sentences max)
- Use specific dollar amounts, not percentages
- Reference realistic historical timeframes
- Avoid giving financial advice disclaimers in the suggestions
- Focus on major market cap stocks for reliability
- Always provide a single investment date for multiple stocks
